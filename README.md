# htr-annotations

Manually annotated images for handwritten text recognition of Finnish migration records, including annotations for page de-skew, table structure, cell type classification, text recognition, and year recognition. 

Source images: Source images for annotations can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/15836012 (jpg format).

Annotations: Annotations are in PageXML format (version 2013-07-15). File names can be used to pair annotations with corrsponding source images.

Train/Dev/Test split: The data is divided into training, development and test directories. In addition to these, pielavesi-directory includes additional annotations, but note that pielavesi-annotations are not radomly sampled, all being from the Pielavesi parish. We suggest to use these as additional training data.
